# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
- **To get started Image Classification with tensorflow I implemented basic neural network which classifies the image and predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy..**
- Created, trained and evaluated a neural network in TensorFlow.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

* Trains a dense neural network to recognize MNIST digits.
* Achieves high accuracy through clear, step-by-step stages:

  1. **Data loading & preprocessing** (normalize pixels, one-hot encode labels)
  2. **Model definition** (input â†’ dense layers â†’ softmax)
  3. **Training** with validation monitoring
  4. **Evaluation** on test data
  5. **Visualization** of sample predictions


## ðŸš€ Extensions & Next Steps

* Add **Dropout** to control overfitting
* Replace dense layers with a **CNN** for improved accuracy
* Test with **Fashion-MNIST** or your own handwritten samples
